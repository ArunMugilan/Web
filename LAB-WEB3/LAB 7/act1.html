    <h1>Awesome view-Batu Buruk Beach</h1>
    <p>"being there on 4/8/2017 with my friends. it's a beautiful beach and had an awesome viewing.
There are 5 couple swings and also if not mistaken 3 single swings along the beach.
I am being there on a sunny day which make the view more amazing. It's really good for seaside walking and relaxing place. It also had street food and itâ€™s lively place on weekend.
