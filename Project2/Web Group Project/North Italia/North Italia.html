                                          1 tablespoon olive oil, 4 tablespoons butter, 3 cloves garlic (minced) <br>
                                          2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, 1 cup pesto sauce, 2 cups cherry tomatoes (quartered) <br>
                                          1/2 cup Parmesan cheese (grated) <br> <br>

                                          <b>Directions</b> <br>
                                          Season the chicken breast with dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Preheat the oven to 400 F.,
                                          Heat the olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet or sauté pan on medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the pan and brown it on both sides for three to five minutes.
                                          Remove the chicken from the pan and place it on a plate. Turn down the heat, add the water to the pan, and deglaze it by scraping at the browned bits on the bottom. Add the butter, garlic and lemon juice
                                          as well. Cook for two to three minutes, or until the butter is completely melted and the garlic is fragrant.
                                          Add the chicken back to the pan and top each piece with an equal amount of the fresh mozzarella. Place it in the preheated oven until the top of the cheese is melted and slightly browned.
                                          Top each chicken breast with an equal amount of the pesto, cherry tomatoes, and Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately with a side salad, pasta, or bread to make it a complete meal.

                                          <b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
                                          1 egg, 1 egg yolk, 15 ml (1 tablespoon) white vinegar, 15 to 30 ml (1 to 2 tablespoons) water
                                          375 ml (1 1/2 cups) <br>unbleached all-purpose flour, 30 ml (2 tablespoons) icing sugar

                                          1 egg white, lightly beaten, Canola oil, for frying, 1 tub 400 g ricotta cheese, drained for 12 hours, 250 ml (1 cup) sugar, 5 ml (1 teaspoon) vanilla extract, 115 g (4 oz) chopped dark chocolate (or chocolate chips)
                                          Icing sugar, for garnish <br> <br>


                                          <b>Directions</b> <br>
                                          In a bowl, combine the egg, egg yolk, vinegar, and water. Set aside.
                                          In a food processor, combine the flour, icing sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt. Add the lard and mix thoroughly. Add the liquids and pulse until the dough forms into a ball. Add water, if needed.
                                          On a work surface, knead the dough for 2 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 1 hour in the refrigerator.
                                          Heat the oil in the deep fryer to 190 °C (375 °F). Line a baking sheet with paper towel.
                                          On a floured work surface, divide the dough into four pieces and shape into rectangles to facilitate running through the pasta machine. Roll a rectangle of dough at a time, dusting with flour if it becomes sticky, up to thickness number 5. Place the rolled out dough rectangles onto the floured surface.
                                          <br>Cut into 10-cm (4-inch) squares. Wrap the dough around a cannoli mould. Layer 2 corners and stick together by brushing one side with the beaten egg white.
                                          Fry 1 or 2 cannoli at a time for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown. Drain on the paper towel.<br> Unmould the cannoli while still hot. Repeat with the remaining dough. Let cool completely.
