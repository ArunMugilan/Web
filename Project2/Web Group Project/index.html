            <h3>Welcom to the world of rich taste</h3>
            <p style=" margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;background:#282E34;color:white">Italian food is about incorporating the healthy and rich ingredients of the Mediterranean into tasty dishes. Often comprised of only four to eight simple
                  ingredients, Italian foods are often made with tomatoes, olive oil, basil, and garlic.

                  Often the tomatoes, zucchini, and eggplants commonly found in Italian food are lightly cooked in olive oil. The diet as a whole is more plant-based compared to other cultures. When meats are included in a meal, poultry and fish are
                  most often used. On occasion, red meat will be grilled and added for additional fat and protein.
                  Although most known for their pasta, Italian dishes often include other options such as polenta, pizza, gnocchi, or risotto. The rich carbohydrates offer a hearty base for the rich sauces and cheeses of the region. However, these
                  foods are consumed in small portions to maintain the overwhelming health factors.

                        Italian food is a surprisingly diverse cuisine. Each of the twenty Italian regions has a distinctive set of flavors, recipes, products, and ingredients. In fact, the Italian regions were not officially united as a nation until
                        the mid-19th century; therefore, each individual region has retained much of its exclusive identity.
                        Climate and natural landscape have played a major role in shaping regional cuisines. Creamy risotto and other delicately flavored dishes predominate in the Northern regions, while bright olive oil and tomato-based recipes rule
                        the sunny South.

                  <p>While it is difficult to say for sure who invented the pizza, it is however believed that modern pizza was first made by baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples. In fact, a popular urban legend holds that the archetypal pizza, Pizza
                        Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he
                        created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen as Pizza Margherita.</p>
